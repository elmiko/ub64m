# UnBase64Manifest - ub64m

A tool to help me with kubernetes manifest wrangling. There is probably a
simpler/more elegant way to do this using standard cli tools, but where's
the fun in that? ðŸ˜‚

This tool will take a [JSON][json] or [YAML][yaml] document and decode
all base64 encoded strings in the values for any field. It will then
print the output as a new [YAML][yaml] file.

## Example use

```
$ cat tests/data/encoded-sample.yaml

```

## Install using cargo

From `$HOME` in your terminal type the following:

```
cargo install ub64m
```

This will install the `ub64m` binary to the `.cargo/bin` directory, please
note that this will need to be in your `$PATH` for easier use.
